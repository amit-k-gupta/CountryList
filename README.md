# CountryList
1. This simple project fetches the CountryList frm the mindbody API and shows here.
2. It additionally fetches the respective country flags and shows against them.
3. When a country is selected, a modal page is opened and states(provinces) for that country are shown.
4. The second page doesn't have any more functionality. Thus avoided UI there. 
5. Provinces modal page can be pulled down to go back to Country screen. Back button has been purposefully not given. 
6. Failed to show map for Country and provinces, thus made the provinces list not selectable. Failure was due to lack of supporting API.
